## A classical checkers game with a little twist

Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/uk/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

It's checkers with a fantasy theme and some powerfull power you can activate to annihilate your foes.

## How to
### Prep the environnement

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node src/server`

### How to play

[Check progress on Heroku](https://checkers-fantasy.herokuapp.com/) (may take a while to load)

## What's working and what ain't?

* All front element working nicely.
* Nothing is up server-side.
* You can play alone against yourself.
* You can play even if it's not suppose to be your turn.
* Power does nothing.


## What's next?

I'll do the server-side logic in a few weeks. And I'll add the powers.
